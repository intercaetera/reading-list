# Reading List

This is a list of all the books I've read since 2018 (that's roughly when I started tracking what I read). I try to follow my own advice from [this blog post](https://intercaetera.com/2020-01-22-two-simple-tips-to-read-more-books/) and read at least ten pages every day. I also try to alternate between things that are useful for my career and things that I just enjoy.

The list is in reverse chronological order (the books I read most recenty are at the top).
